<p>Hello 👋🏼 - I am back. I hope you have already read the prelude here 👇🏼</p>

<p><a href="https://www.notion.so/How-I-moved-to-being-a-developer-from-a-tester-5345e487ef614f479a617f8234a1856b">How I moved to being a developer from a tester…</a></p>

<p>If you haven’t - well just go on reading this post - I am glad you are here and would respect your time - so no need to go back and read right now 🙆🏻‍♀️</p>

<p>So - where was I .. Ah yes! How a QA engineer (tester)🔍🐞 with more than half a decade of experience moved to being a developer 👩🏻‍💻. Well, honestly - when I started as a manual tester - from day 1 (or probably the day I understood what my job requires) - I started requesting for a role change.</p>

<p>I, in no way want to demean the role, and slowly you will realize how much my previous role helps my current one. Only - I love absolute honesty and that is how I will present myself - my exact thoughts at each stage, my decisions, what I missed and what I grabbed.</p>

<p><img src="/blogs/images/decision.jpg" alt="" title="Source credit: https://online.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/styles/figure_default/public/2018-03/mse_introdecisionanalysis_mse152.jpg"></p>

<p>In large MNCs - there is mostly no process of determining who should be tagged <img class="emoji" title=":link:" alt=":link:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f517.png" height="20" width="20"> to which technology. In a batch of 1000 students <img class="emoji" title=":busts_in_silhouette:" alt=":busts_in_silhouette:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f465.png" height="20" width="20"> - no one has the time to judge your capabilities - and my fate landed me in a batch of Manual Testing. Initially people kept saying - this is great, it means quick onsite opportunities <img class="emoji" title=":airplane:" alt=":airplane:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2708.png" height="20" width="20">- I really did not know what the role was and was thrilled at this suggestion. 
As soon as the training unfolded - I realized I did not want onsite at the cost of “no coding”. Terms like “automation”, “white/black/gray box” were aboslutely new - and I knew all I had to work with was “Decoding requirements and wording tests”. I started slipping into hopelessness by the day.</p>

<p><img src="/blogs/images/black-white-gray.png" alt="" title="Source credit: https://www.ranorex.com/black-box-testing-tools/"></p>

<p>Guidance matters - and I had none. No one told me that it was okay to look for another job right then - so I continued. I kept on working at writing test cases in excel sheets, manually executing them, learning the domain and the most important of all - understanding requirements. Whenever there was an opportunity - I did not forget to highlight my aspirations - I knew movement to development was almost not possible but the closest I could move to code was being an “Automation Engineer”.</p>

<p><img src="/blogs/images/manual-vs-Automation-Testing.png" alt="" title="Source credit: https://www.agileinfoways.com/blog/pros-and-cons-of-manual-testing-vs-automation-testing-tools-what-to-choose-and-why/"></p>

<p>And I took up every opportunity of building something in-house - failing at almost every task - because I had <em>No Guidance</em>. I did not know what frameworks were, I did not know how to develop websites - it all looked so dreamy, magical and out of reach <img class="emoji" title=":sob:" alt=":sob:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f62d.png" height="20" width="20">. When I was told to contribute in an Android <img class="emoji" title=":iphone:" alt=":iphone:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4f1.png" height="20" width="20"> application that was being built in-house - I could not understand anything<img class="emoji" title=":dizzy_face:" alt=":dizzy_face:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f635.png" height="20" width="20"> in the 2 days provided to learn, and faltered to deliver. I kept losing faith in myself - but today when I look back, the only thing that is visible is - <strong>the scenario was bound to fail</strong>. I cannot expect myself to create a production ready UX design in just 2 days of learning android development. And it is Okay. <img class="emoji" title=":purple_heart:" alt=":purple_heart:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f49c.png" height="20" width="20"> Many times we fail some tests because the tests are wrong - you cannot expect a baby bird to fly in a day. <img class="emoji" title=":hatching_chick:" alt=":hatching_chick:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f423.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<p>But I proved my mettle wherever possible. I never backed out on any added responsibilities - and delivered more than what was expected. One day, out of the blue, I got a message from a friend in a different team - that an automation training was being organized for a new batch of trainees. I decided to go out of my way and ask my manager to enroll me in the training. It was not an easy talk - it really took a lot of reasoning and a little bit of displeasure, topped with extra working hours - but I finally got what I wanted. 1 week of training, going to office early and working late to compensate for the work - all did help in one main thing - I got noticed. <img class="emoji" title=":raising_hand:" alt=":raising_hand:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f64b.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<p>So as soon as my current project ended - after a long tenure (at least for me) of 1 year - I was presented with the role of an Automation engineer in another project.</p>

<p>What happened next you say? Stay tuned for the next chapter the upcoming week.. Till then.. Okka Bye 👩🏻‍💻</p>
