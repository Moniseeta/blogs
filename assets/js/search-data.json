            "content": "“If you want to move to development, we can look into it” - I was dumbfounded. 😮 The same organization where I had worked for 6 long years - and had asked for this from the very first day - was offering me “development” when I had finally decided to move out. 😦 . Hello readers 👋🏼 This is the final blog of this series - my journey from starting as a manual tester to being a software developer today. Well, this is where I had left off in my last post - let’s resume. . The year was 2019 - in the beginning of the year - I had asked for a promotion - because, honestly - I felt that I deserved it. The work we had delivered, the way I had toiled in the last 9-10 months - I did not expect a response - “Not possible this year - we can try in the next”. Strange enough - as soon as I put down my papers - I was offered all - a promotion, a possible onsite as soon as there is a requirement, and even - movement to development. 😐 . I still have this question - probably will always have - why is it, when an employee decides to part ways with the organization - are his/her demands fulfilled? A huge hike to match the new offer, or any other thing that was “impossible” just a month back - are all served on a tray. I do not blame my managers or supervisors for this - but company policies like these do not make sense to me. 😕 . Anyways, it was not an easy decision - because for joining Aqua, I had to relocate to a different city. I was not sure if I would ever be offered development there. And my leadership in my previous organization was actually leaving no stones unturned - they even spoke to the Data Science Team for my transition (yeah, well I was a little into machine learning back then - trying to understand what the buzz was all about.. Right now - let’s just say that mathematics and I cannot live together happily ever after 😵- so I closed that chapter). . But, somewhere, deep within my heart, I wanted to join Aqua. So, I decided to talk to the research and development (RnD) Head of Aqua India - about my aspirations and what my current organization was offering. . Whoa! Speak directly with the RnD Head? Well, I had my second round of interview with him and from that instant - something had clicked. He is one of the most cheerful, approachable, positive people I have worked with. 🤩 By that time too, I had had a few conversations with him, over mail and call - and every time I felt this wish of working together growing in me. So, I pinged him and in few minutes, he called me back. . Here, let me tell something - when I had this conversation - I did not mention about the promotion or onsite opportunities that I was being offered. Because, honestly - those did not matter to me as much. I told him - “I do not know how to say this, but my current organization is offering me movement to development. And this is what I have always aspired for. I still do want to move to Aqua - but is there any way that I might get to move to development?” And his answer was so honest - I do understand and respect your aspiration. So, yes, we do have internal mobility here in Aqua. But, right now I will not be able to offer you this - because we need a QA member. What I can promise is - I will keep this in mind and make it happen once you are comfortable with your current role, the technology stack and we have a stable QA team. . This matters a lot - to be able to bring transparency to the table. I am not a day-dreamer; of-course I knew that I could not join Aqua as a developer - because honestly - I knew nothing of it. And whatever he said - it made absolute sense. So, I took the leap of faith 🕊️ and moved on to Aqua. . The confused state and coming out of it had helped me a lot in this decision. Because I was clear on what I was looking for. . When I started in the new job, it was a very bumpy ride.🚵 Moving to a different city - I realized that the world was so much ahead of where I was earlier. The technology stack, the way of work, it was completely different. Initially, I could not understand anything. 😭 Neither the product, nor docker, orchestrators, or every other thing that was being spoken about. . . I believe God has his own way of helping you if you are really trying. In that cacophony, I found a colleague who saw my struggle and decided to pull me out of the mess. From answering my questions to helping me out whenever I was stuck - he has always been my go-to wiki. 🙋 So I put in my everything - I learnt what docker was, how it worked, learnt the product, the new automation framework with Python and Pytest, CI jobs using Jenkins, and much more. And the team stood by me - be it the team in India or Aqua Global - the one thing is - they have got your back. 💝 . Even here - it was not a cup of tea to move to development. I had to prove myself worthy and excel in the role of a QA Engineer. I was really slow in the beginning, but by the end of a year - I was confident. Things that I had learnt from my previous organization - main being documentation, analysis, trying to see the complete picture - helped me a lot. . So, slowly - goals were being set for me to prep myself for the next role. I was to learn Golang, VueJs, PostgreSQL. I had also decided to certify in CKA, CKAD1 (Kubernetes certifications). It was really a bite more than I could chew - and I felt lost many times. It is okay to fall - we all do - only that we need to get up. . . I did get up. After almost 1.9 years as a QA Automation engineer in Aqua, I finally transitioned into the role of a Software developer. 🥂 🙌 . Well, it was not a complete transition. Initially I had to spend time with the new QA team - with onboarding, query resolutions and much more (Even now, I do that sometimes - the frequency is much less though). And I am still struggling in many places with my new role - because again - a lot to learn in very small time. Yes, I knew what I was up for - and I know I will be there soon. 💗 . So, wrapping up this series with - I had a dream 💭 and I saw it bloom into reality. I know all dreams do not come true - but some definitely do. Thank you for being with me though this series. Planning to come up with more technical takeaways from my daily learning in the next blogs.. Hope to see you there… à bientôt..

            "content": "👋🏼 Welcome to the pre-finale of this series. . Moving from being a Tester to a Developer was neither an easy path, nor a quick jump. It was years of experience, information and a deep rooted passion that brought me here. . In the last blog, I told you why I was stuck being in a confused state - about what I really wanted. 🤲🏼 . Now, for all of us, the heart and mind are not always in sync. 🙂 My heart always knew what it wanted, but my mind was realizing the reality - that time was running out. ⌛ So, I had to polish my skills, I had to be a Good Automation Tester. Well, not that I was bad, but I knew there was room for improvement - to be at par with the market. And I constantly started looking for opportunities to learn more. . Again a project ending - again a new project; and this New Project was a “Jet Pack” 🚀. My Lead cum Manager from my last project was helming a new customer - it was a pure automation project on which we had to start from scratch. She pulled me in - yes both of us were the only members of the QA offshore team. Somehow, she believed in me - though I was scared out of sleep with the responsibility that was being given to me. 😨 . Our clients wanted specific problems to be handled - and for that our internal Automation Expert team suggested an in-house custom framework - which is also widely used by different companies for their automation. The framework is extremely scalable, supports a lot of browsers, CICD and what not. But for me, to start with - I had no idea about Page Object Models, Maven, TestNG, Cucumber (Behaviour Driven Development), etc. 😱 - and this framework used it all. So, I had to learn all of it as soon as I could - because I was answerable to any question that our client might have - whether our framework could or could not solve everything that they were looking for. Thus, with just an hour of session on how the framework works - I started. . . It was not easy - I always feared of doing things wrong. But I was adamant to never show it - adamant to grab this opportunity to learn. Soon enough, I got the control I needed, and in 4 months - I had written more code in Selenium, worked on Pom.xml, understood and used TestNG; than I ever had in the past 4 years. 💪🏼 . Yet, this was not the biggest challenge. After the first phase of delivery, our client was happy with what we did but - they wanted us to move to Ruby with RSpec1 and Watir2. Why? Because their own automation team was using it, and they felt more comfortable. They shared with us the framework that they used - so we had to buckle up and start delivering. By then, a few more members had joined in our team - and honestly - all of them were the best kind of people you could work with. But none of us had any experience of working with Ruby. 😐 I had Java in my college, and had just written “hello world” in Python. . . I will not go into the details of how we got it to work - but the learning was a steep curve. 📈 Not only did I learn Ruby, but also a lot in Jenkins while trying to build the jobs to run our tests. Watir was not easy either - since it is not as widely used. None of the existing projects were using these, we were devoid of Ruby expertise and small issues took quite long to resolve. . I think this made me so strong - I gained the confidence to update my resume and give it a shot. . Few things to mention here: . It was not that I was not looking for a switch already. I had created a profile in many sites - with no response. 😞 | One of my best friends who was also in my “Manual Testing” training batch - had switched to another company (foregoing the lure of “Onsite” opportunity). And there - he was lucky to be in a project that saw the mettle in him and he transitioned to be a full stack developer. He was (still is) an inspiration to me. 🧑🏼‍💻 | A colleague had once mentioned that “start-ups” are the best places for mobility - role changes are much more heard of and supported. 🤝 Even one of my supervisors had once told me - “If you are looking for transitioning to development, it is difficult here. We are not start ups, so the process is complicated”. | I had seen many many people move from development to testing. I never understood why the opposite transition could be so complicated !! Is it because of some prejudice about the technical hold of a QA Engineer? I still do not have an answer to it - but yes, I do have an answer for it - any one can be anything if they put there heart into it. . So - one fine evening in 2019, I got a call. It was from the HR of AquaSecurity. Well, honestly - initially I could not make out the name of the company (I was applying vigorously to multiple positions in different companies back then), because it was not one of the commonly heard of names. She told me - “Moniseeta, we have received your application on LinkedIn and would like to schedule an interview with you. But before that - I would like you to know that we are a start up, so the work here will be difficult, might require more time. Plus, the skill-sets that we are looking for do not actually match with yours, so you might need to put in extra effort to prepare before your interviews. Are you okay with it?”. I had the answer at the tip of my tongue - “Yesss!” . The next was a series of interviews - I really tried a lot to learn Python 🐍 and Docker 🐋 and what not, brush up on Selenium, OOPs (object oriented programming concepts), Java - all of this in a few days. There was the first round of writing a test suite with Python and Pytest3 and I did that in one night. I learnt it enough to be able to submit the code. Then the interviews, first one was a mess but my interviewer decided to take a chance with me. Second one onward, I performed better. Every time I was told that there would be another round, I would freak. But finally - I made it.✌️ I knew how much I wanted to be in Aqua. Because I could not get a better place to skyrocket my learning. . . Finally, the day I got the offer letter, I was elated. I put down my papers, and then some weird things happened. In the exit interview, I had mentioned my reason of moving out to be “technical stagnancy” - because indeed my main motive was to upgrade myself. The HR conveyed the same to my senior manager, and he decided to talk to me personally. I told him my concerns, why I had made this decision. And he offered me something that I had never ever imagined - the option to move to development. 😲 . What happened next? Stay tuned for the final blog - coming next Tuesday. Okka Bye.. 👩🏻‍💻👋🏼 .

            "title": "The confused space",
            "content": "Hello 👋🏼 . So, continuing from where I left off last week. (Where did I leave off last week? 🤔 What is this story all about? Do you need to go back and read all previous chapters? 😟 - Don’t worry about these questions 🙃 I am just sharing my journey from a Tester to a Developer. Each post 📄 is like a summary of a string of events that led ➡️ the path) . And the regulars who have been with me from sometime now - do you have an answer? Any pattern in “what I did wrong?” . The answer is - I feared being judged as incapable. I yearned for too much acceptance from others - but forgot the simple trick - I need to accept myself first. . Now the second dangling topic from last post - what is an Automation Maintenance Engineer? Well, this was when I mentioned my role to be that of an Automation Tester, but all I ever did was fix “broken” tests. Oh no no - not fix broken scripts - fix broken tests (on excel sheet - changing test data, adding new keywords 😒) . Please don’t assume that it was an easy task, because the quantity of test suites was huge. We had almost 8-10 applications which were candidates of automation. 😨 Out of those - few had regression1 suites of 700-800 test cases that had to be run every fortnight. I still remember - we had 5-6 spare desktops in our project - we called them “middle systems” - for running automation. And we literally used to run between them: to monitor, to trigger, to check results and what not. Even today I do not know if “Automated” tests could need so much of “Physical” effort 🏃🏻‍♀️😫 . It was not a single technology- we had a hybrid framework with Selenium, 5 different frameworks with UFT, 1 with Sikuli plus multiple “scripts” to ease 😏 the effort. . . In the burden of managing all of this, coding something new was never a priority. Yet, the worm 🐛 of coding made me do funny things. A senior once told - “I understand you love coding, but don’t write a new method on every opportunity.” . So, yes - that is what I did for more than 2 years - maintained some automation suites, triggered them, reran the failed ones and scratched my head trying to figure out if the failed test is because of an actual bug or just a “sporadic” issue. This could have easily been a red flag - because I was not learning the technology - I was exhausted by the end of the day. 😮‍💨 I was stuck between knowing “I am not skilled enough for a job change” and “I don’t have time to work on self learning”. . Meanwhile I planned to pursue higher studies. I appeared for “GATE” and “GRE” - but as you can easily guess - did not achieve the required score because “Not enough time”. I heard whispers of people - saying- oh Manual testing is end of career, you would not make far with it. So my only option out seemed via higher studies - and I failed there too. 😭 . (P.S - My personal opinion - Manual testing is never going out of business - because it is not only testing the set of existing test suite - it is about the thought - how can the system break. It has its own importance.) . Now, looking back, I realize - higher studies was never for me. I have never been studious, so even if I had made it to an elite institution - I would still be a back-bench-er. Being focused is very important to make an optimized move. Also, if I was unable to learn or grow in the current position, I should have started applying elsewhere. While appearing for interviews, I could have understood the market requirements, prepared myself. . In that “confused space” - I thought everyone else is doing better. Someone was switching to a different company with a hike, someone pursuing MBA/MTech, someone traveling to onsite location. I blamed myself for wanting to be a Developer 😡- because I started to believe that it won’t ever happen. . . ▶️ The first rule of getting through this confusion is - listen to everything but don’t try to apply the same formula to your life. Not every medicine is effective for everyone - the prescription will be different. Once I started cutting out the unwanted information - I realized what I wanted. . ▶️ Secondly, people will tell you what they think is the best for you - but honestly - no one knows what is going to happen. So if you feel like, take risks. Do what you want to do. You are answerable to only yourself. . ▶️ Finally - my stint as “Automation Maintenance Engineer” was not all waste. I learnt handling frequent context switches, I learnt “not breaking” under pressure. And I would definitely say - I had great seniors at work. So I was never reprimanded for mistakes. I was still given more responsibilities - which helped me build the confidence in myself. . And special mention to my first manager - who has always been there to hear my childish blabbering, never being impatient. I still remember a very important thing he said - “Even if you do move to development, the testing will always be an additional skill. This, which is your bread and butter right now, will always give you that extra edge”. I learnt from him, how to be a leader - not a “boss”. . The next chapter will unfold my first “proper” automation task - and then a big change… So see you next Tuesday.. Okka, Bye 👩🏻‍💻 . regression - When any new feature/changes are introduced in an application (think app updates with new features) - the existing features should be tested - ‘coz no one likes “Oh why is this not working, it used to work!! 😠😩”. This is regression testing. &#8617; . |",

            "content": "Hello Readers 👋🏼 So glad that you are here. . Recap 📜 : I am a software developer now, after 7 years of being a QA engineer. The original journey was that of a Manual Tester → Automation Maintenance Engineer (I know that is not even a term but you will soon relate to it) → Automation Engineer → Software Developer. In the last 2 posts, I began telling you the story of how it all began and how I managed to get noticed as capable of being an automation engineer. . . So, once my first project ended, the entire team was split up and absorbed into different projects. . I was to fill in the shoes 👠of one stalwart automation engineer. I still remember my first introduction to Selenium 🤖- I was handed an excel file with some existing test cases, some keywords, data, test steps - and a 30 minutes of “How to run”. I did not ask 😓- what is Selenium, where is it being used, how does it work - nothing. I came back to my desk, and worked on the setup - triggered a test case which ran all green 🟢. . . There were instances in future where I was asked to provide “KT or Knowledge Transfer” sessions 👩‍🏫 on Selenium - and I always feared of teaching it wrong, of not knowing an answer 😟. . Hey stop..✋ don’t think I am trying to cut a sorry picture. Let me now go back and share the analysis of what I did wrong and how I made/could have made it right. . . Wrong: . Not asking- be it a question, assistance or guidance. | Being a perfectionist - no mistakes allowed. ❌ | Right: . Ensuring delivery - this is the key 🗝️ in building trust 🤝 and being valued. | Improved “Google Search”. 🔍 (Well yes it can be any search, but Google is what I used and still do use 😅) . It is not just me, various posts on different platforms do mention “being able to Google” as a sought after skill - because trust me - no one knows it all - you just need to know what to look for. 😉💡 . | Teaching. 👩🏻‍🏫 I learnt with total honesty- because I knew that I could not impart incorrect information. | Investigative attitude 🕵🏼 . A question I did not have an answer to made me all the more curious. This helped me later in many “root cause analysis”. | Absolute honest efforts. This helped me gain a long term foothold on subjects I worked in. | Observe 👀, analyze, learn, repeat 🔃 | What could have been done differently: . Ask. Questions, requests for sessions, documentation - anything that you might need to gear up - go ahead and ask for it. It helps in 2 main ways : You are ready to deliver much faster 🚀- team is benefited | You make less ignorant mistakes 🤦🏽‍♀️ 📉. | ⚠️ Some terms and conditions applied to the above ⚠️ . ** There is a thin line between “spoon feeding” 🥣 and “requesting for help when required” 🆘. Ensure that you have tried everything you could, before approaching someone. Respect everyone’s time. . ** Have specific and constructive asks - Instead of “I need a session on Selenium”, a better question is “How is of Selenium implemented in the current project?” . | I know I am still not there yet - but try to overcome the “self- doubt”. You know you will be able to prove yourself - just not yet - but soon. 🍀 | Spend time on learning ✏️🗓️- it is the most difficult thing. And don’t make it a “resolution”. Breaking a “resolution” makes us lose the battle half way - so learn whenever you can and you feel like. There is so much knowledge and such little time - it is very easy to get derailed. No one-shot formula of learning that works for all - I can only share what works for me. I can only motivate myself to learn things that need me to get a job done. So I always try to learn things while working on them - being curious and asking more “whys”. 🤔 | Well,well - A lot of “preaching” 😄 But now a question for you .. Did you observe any pattern in “what I did wrong”? You have 1 week to think.. Till then.. Keep dreaming.. . Psst.. What is “Automation Maintenance Engineer”? Stay tuned for next blog 😜 .

            "content": "Hello 👋🏼 - I am back. I hope you have already read the prelude here 👇🏼 . How I moved to being a developer from a tester… . If you haven’t - well just go on reading this post - I am glad you are here and would respect your time - so no need to go back and read right now 🙆🏻‍♀️ . So - where was I .. Ah yes! How a QA engineer (tester)🔍🐞 with more than half a decade of experience moved to being a developer 👩🏻‍💻. Well, honestly - when I started as a manual tester - from day 1 (or probably the day I understood what my job requires) - I started requesting for a role change. . I, in no way want to demean the role, and slowly you will realize how much my previous role helps my current one. Only - I love absolute honesty and that is how I will present myself - my exact thoughts at each stage, my decisions, what I missed and what I grabbed. . . In large MNCs - there is mostly no process of determining who should be tagged :link: to which technology. In a batch of 1000 students :busts_in_silhouette: - no one has the time to judge your capabilities - and my fate landed me in a batch of Manual Testing. Initially people kept saying - this is great, it means quick onsite opportunities :airplane:- I really did not know what the role was and was thrilled at this suggestion. As soon as the training unfolded - I realized I did not want onsite at the cost of “no coding”. Terms like “automation”, “white/black/gray box” were aboslutely new - and I knew all I had to work with was “Decoding requirements and wording tests”. I started slipping into hopelessness by the day. . . Guidance matters - and I had none. No one told me that it was okay to look for another job right then - so I continued. I kept on working at writing test cases in excel sheets, manually executing them, learning the domain and the most important of all - understanding requirements. Whenever there was an opportunity - I did not forget to highlight my aspirations - I knew movement to development was almost not possible but the closest I could move to code was being an “Automation Engineer”. . . And I took up every opportunity of building something in-house - failing at almost every task - because I had No Guidance. I did not know what frameworks were, I did not know how to develop websites - it all looked so dreamy, magical and out of reach :sob:. When I was told to contribute in an Android :iphone: application that was being built in-house - I could not understand anything:dizzy_face: in the 2 days provided to learn, and faltered to deliver. I kept losing faith in myself - but today when I look back, the only thing that is visible is - the scenario was bound to fail. I cannot expect myself to create a production ready UX design in just 2 days of learning android development. And it is Okay. :purple_heart: Many times we fail some tests because the tests are wrong - you cannot expect a baby bird to fly in a day. :hatching_chick: . But I proved my mettle wherever possible. I never backed out on any added responsibilities - and delivered more than what was expected. One day, out of the blue, I got a message from a friend in a different team - that an automation training was being organized for a new batch of trainees. I decided to go out of my way and ask my manager to enroll me in the training. It was not an easy talk - it really took a lot of reasoning and a little bit of displeasure, topped with extra working hours - but I finally got what I wanted. 1 week of training, going to office early and working late to compensate for the work - all did help in one main thing - I got noticed. :raising_hand: . So as soon as my current project ended - after a long tenure (at least for me) of 1 year - I was presented with the role of an Automation engineer in another project. . What happened next you say? Stay tuned for the next chapter the upcoming week.. Till then.. Okka Bye 👩🏻‍💻 .",

            "content": "Hi, let me introduce myself first. I am Moniseeta - a “Software Developer” in one of the leading cloud native security providers. (Which one? I will reveal but not yet :innocent:) . But life was not always the same. 🙄 I was born (in this world of software) - as a Manual tester. . . Well, I had never been a studious child :grimacing: - but programming always intrigued me. So, when I was placed in an MNC from college on-campus recruitment drive - believe me - I was super pumped up. . I even imagined solving tricky situations with my coding analytics :sunglasses:- you know - how a struggling actor feels he will re-enact a scene better than the original cast - until he faces the reality - that he is still nowhere near to be discovered, let alone being cast for “that” role. :persevere: . I felt the same churn in my stomach when I realized :broken_heart: - there was absolutely “no coding” requirement in my job profile. Many of you might disagree with me - and say - if you love to code, you will find the requirements in your daily activity. But trust me - with the work pressure - there is no “free” space of mind or time to analyze my daily activities. And then to know “WHAT” to use to automate it. . . So, today as I sit back and reminisce - I feel an urge to share how things worked out for me. I had been searching for these answers on different channels - Quora, Medium and what not. And only to believe - it is never going to happen.:disappointed: . But it did happen, and I want you to believe the same. I have finally mustered the courage to share my journey with you, not what has happened but also - what is happening. I will try to capture the different “technical” and “non-technical” patches of activities in this series of blog posts - and make it interactive to my best possible way. I hope the dreamers in all of you do hold on to your dreams while we embark on this journey.. See you in the next post.. Okka bye 👩🏻‍💻 .",

The last 8 years of donning the hat :tophat: of a software professional drifted me away from my ink pot and quill ✒️. . So I decided to make use of both the worlds - and pour my creativity technically 🪄- forego the notepad and create some blog posts - talking about many things that I learn 👩‍💻 with a pinch of my emotions. 🧂 .
