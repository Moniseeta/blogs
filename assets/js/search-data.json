            "content": "Hello Readers 👋🏼 So glad that you are here. . Recap 📜 : I am a software developer now, after 7 years of being a QA engineer. The original journey was that of a Manual Tester → Automation Maintenance Engineer (I know that is not even a term but you will soon relate to it) → Automation Engineer → Software Developer. In the last 2 posts, I began telling you the story of how it all began and how I managed to get noticed as capable of being an automation engineer. . . So, once my first project ended, the entire team was split up and absorbed into different projects. . I was to fill in the shoes 👠of one stalwart automation engineer. I still remember my first introduction to Selenium 🤖- I was handed an excel file with some existing test cases, some keywords, data, test steps - and a 30 minutes of “How to run”. I did not ask 😓- what is Selenium, where is it being used, how does it work - nothing. I came back to my desk, and worked on the setup - triggered a test case which ran all green 🟢. . . There were instances in future where I was asked to provide “KT or Knowledge Transfer” sessions 👩‍🏫 on Selenium - and I always feared of teaching it wrong, of not knowing an answer 😟. . Hey stop..✋ don’t think I am trying to cut a sorry picture. Let me now go back and share the analysis of what I did wrong and how I made/could have made it right. . . Wrong: . Not asking- be it a question, assistance or guidance. | Being a perfectionist - no mistakes allowed. ❌ | Right: . Ensuring delivery - this is the key 🗝️ in building trust 🤝 and being valued. | Improved “Google Search”. 🔍 (Well yes it can be any search, but Google is what I used and still do use 😅) . It is not just me, various posts on different platforms do mention “being able to Google” as a sought after skill - because trust me - no one knows it all - you just need to know what to look for. 😉💡 . | Teaching. 👩🏻‍🏫 I learnt with total honesty- because I knew that I could not impart incorrect information. | Investigative attitude 🕵🏼 . A question I did not have | Absolute honest efforts. This helped me gain a long term foothold on subjects I worked in. | Observe 👀, analyze, learn, repeat 🔃 | What could have been done differently: . Ask. Questions, requests for sessions, documentation - anything that you might need to gear up - go ahead and ask for it. It helps in 2 main ways : You are ready to deliver much faster 🚀- team is benefited | You make less ignorant mistakes 🤦🏽‍♀️ 📉. | ⚠️ Some terms and conditions applied to the above ⚠️ . ** There is a thin line between “spoon feeding” 🥣 and “requesting for help when required” 🆘. Ensure that you have tried everything you could, before approaching someone. Respect everyone’s time. . ** Have specific and constructive asks - Instead of “I need a session on Selenium”, a better question is “How is of Selenium implemented in the current project?” . | I know I am still not there yet - but try to overcome the “self- doubt”. You know you will be able to prove yourself - just not yet - but soon. 🍀 | Spend time on learning ✏️🗓️- it is the most difficult thing. And don’t make it a “resolution”. Breaking a “resolution” makes us lose the battle half way - so learn whenever you can and you feel like. There is so much knowledge and such little time - it is very easy to get derailed. No one-shot formula of learning that works for all - I can only share what works for me. I can only motivate myself to learn things that need me to get a job done. So I always try to learn things while working on them - being curious and asking more “whys”. 🤔 | Well,well - A lot of “preaching” 😄 But now a question for you .. Did you observe any pattern in “what I did wrong”? You have 1 week to think.. Till then.. Keep dreaming.. . Psst.. What is “Automation Maintenance Engineer”? Stay tuned for next blog 😜 . Okka bye 👋🏼 👩🏻‍💻 .",

            "content": "Hello 👋🏼 - I am back. I hope you have already read the prelude here 👇🏼 . How I moved to being a developer from a tester… . If you haven’t - well just go on reading this post - I am glad you are here and would respect your time - so no need to go back and read right now 🙆🏻‍♀️ . So - where was I .. Ah yes! How a QA engineer (tester)🔍🐞 with more than half a decade of experience moved to being a developer 👩🏻‍💻. Well, honestly - when I started as a manual tester - from day 1 (or probably the day I understood what my job requires) - I started requesting for a role change. . I, in no way want to demean the role, and slowly you will realize how much my previous role helps my current one. Only - I love absolute honesty and that is how I will present myself - my exact thoughts at each stage, my decisions, what I missed and what I grabbed. . . In large MNCs - there is mostly no process of determining who should be tagged :link: to which technology. In a batch of 1000 students :busts_in_silhouette: - no one has the time to judge your capabilities - and my fate landed me in a batch of Manual Testing. Initially people kept saying - this is great, it means quick onsite opportunities :airplane:- I really did not know what the role was and was thrilled at this suggestion. As soon as the training unfolded - I realized I did not want onsite at the cost of “no coding”. Terms like “automation”, “white/black/gray box” were aboslutely new - and I knew all I had to work with was “Decoding requirements and wording tests”. I started slipping into hopelessness by the day. . . Guidance matters - and I had none. No one told me that it was okay to look for another job right then - so I continued. I kept on working at writing test cases in excel sheets, manually executing them, learning the domain and the most important of all - understanding requirements. Whenever there was an opportunity - I did not forget to highlight my aspirations - I knew movement to development was almost not possible but the closest I could move to code was being an “Automation Engineer”. . . And I took up every opportunity of building something in-house - failing at almost every task - because I had No Guidance. I did not know what frameworks were, I did not know how to develop websites - it all looked so dreamy, magical and out of reach :sob:. When I was told to contribute in an Android :iphone: application that was being built in-house - I could not understand anything:dizzy_face: in the 2 days provided to learn, and faltered to deliver. I kept losing faith in myself - but today when I look back, the only thing that is visible is - the scenario was bound to fail. I cannot expect myself to create a production ready UX design in just 2 days of learning android development. And it is Okay. :purple_heart: Many times we fail some tests because the tests are wrong - you cannot expect a baby bird to fly in a day. :hatching_chick: . But I proved my mettle wherever possible. I never backed out on any added responsibilities - and delivered more than what was expected. One day, out of the blue, I got a message from a friend in a different team - that an automation training was being organized for a new batch of trainees. I decided to go out of my way and ask my manager to enroll me in the training. It was not an easy talk - it really took a lot of reasoning and a little bit of displeasure, topped with extra working hours - but I finally got what I wanted. 1 week of training, going to office early and working late to compensate for the work - all did help in one main thing - I got noticed. :raising_hand: . So as soon as my current project ended - after a long tenure (at least for me) of 1 year - I was presented with the role of an Automation engineer in another project. . What happened next you say? Stay tuned for the next chapter the upcoming week.. Till then.. Okka Bye 👩🏻‍💻 .",

            "content": "Hi, let me introduce myself first. I am Moniseeta - a “Software Developer” in one of the leading cloud native security providers. (Which one? I will reveal but not yet :innocent:) . But life was not always the same. 🙄 I was born (in this world of software) - as a Manual tester. . . Well, I had never been a studious child :grimacing: - but programming always intrigued me. So, when I was placed in an MNC from college on-campus recruitment drive - believe me - I was super pumped up. . I even imagined solving tricky situations with my coding analytics :sunglasses:- you know - how a struggling actor feels he will re-enact a scene better than the original cast - until he faces the reality - that he is still nowhere near to be discovered, let alone being cast for “that” role. :persevere: . I felt the same churn in my stomach when I realized :broken_heart: - there was absolutely “no coding” requirement in my job profile. Many of you might disagree with me - and say - if you love to code, you will find the requirements in your daily activity. But trust me - with the work pressure - there is no “free” space of mind or time to analyze my daily activities. And then to know “WHAT” to use to automate it. . . So, today as I sit back and reminisce - I feel an urge to share how things worked out for me. I had been searching for these answers on different channels - Quora, Medium and what not. And only to believe - it is never going to happen.:disappointed: . But it did happen, and I want you to believe the same. I have finally mustered the courage to share my journey with you, not what has happened but also - what is happening. I will try to capture the different “technical” and “non-technical” patches of activities in this series of blog posts - and make it interactive to my best possible way. I hope the dreamers in all of you do hold on to your dreams while we embark on this journey.. See you in the next post.. Okka bye 👩🏻‍💻 .",
