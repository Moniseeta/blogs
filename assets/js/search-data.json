            "content": "Hello 👋🏼 - I am back. I hope you have already read the prelude here 👇🏼 . How I moved to being a developer from a tester… . If you haven’t - well just go on reading this post - I am glad you are here and would respect your time - so no need to go back and read right now 🙆🏻‍♀️ . So - where was I .. Ah yes ! how a QA engineer (tester)🔍🐞 with more than half a decade of experience moved to being a developer 👩🏻‍💻. Well, honestly - when I started as a manual tester - from day 1 (or probably the day I understood what my job requires) - I started requesting for a role change. . I, in no way want to demean the role, and slowly you will realize how much my previous role helps my current one. Only - I love absolute honesty and that is how I will present myself - my exact thoughts at each stage, my decisions, what I missed and what I grabbed. . In large MNCs - there is mostly no process of determining who should be tagged :link: to which technology. In a batch of 1000 students - no one has the time to judge your capabilities - and my fate landed me in a batch of Manual Testing. Initially people kept saying - this is great, it means quick onsite opportunities - I really did not know what the role was and was thrilled at this suggestion. As soon as the training unfolded - I realized I did not want onsite at the cost of “no coding”. Terms like “automation”, “white/black/gray box” were aboslutely new - and I knew all I had to work with was “Decoding requirements and wording tests”. I started slipping into hopelessness by the day. . . Guidance matters - and I had none. No one told me that it was okay to look for another job right then - so I continued. I kept on working at writing test cases in excel sheets, manually executing them, learning the domain and the most important of all - understanding requirements. Whenever there was an opportunity - I did not forget to highlight my aspirations - I knew movement to development was almost not possible but the closest I could move to code was being an “Automation Engineer”. And I took up every opportunity of building something in-house - failing at almost every task - because I had No Guidance. I did not know what frameworks were, I did not know how to develop websites - it all looked so dreamy, magical and out of reach :sob:. When I was told to contribute in an Android :iphone: application that was being built in-house - I could not understand anything:dizzy_face: in the 2 days provided to learn, and faltered to deliver. I kept losing faith in myself - but today when I look back, the only thing that is visible is - the scenario was bound to fail. I cannot expect myself to create a production ready UX design in just 2 days of learning android development. And it is Okay. :purple_heart: Many times we fail some tests because the tests are wrong - you cannot expect a baby bird to fly in a day. :hatching_chick: . But I proved my mettle wherever possible. I never backed out on any added responsibilities - and delivered more than what was expected. One day, out of the blue, I got a message from a friend in a different team - that an automation training was being organized for a new batch of trainees. I decided to go out of my way and ask my manager to enroll me in the training. It was not an easy talk - it really took a lot of reasoning and a little bit of displeasure, topped with extra working hours - but I finally got what I wanted. 1 week of training, going to office early and working late to compensate for the work - all did help in one main thing - I got noticed. :raising_hand: . So as soon as my current project ended - after a long tenure (at least for me) of 1 year - I was presented with the role of an Automation engineer in another project. . What happened next you say? Stay tuned for the next chapter next week.. Till then.. Okka Bye 👩🏻‍💻 .",

            "content": "Hi, let me introduce myself first. I am Moniseeta - a “Software Developer” in one of the leading cloud native security providers. (Which one? I will reveal but not yet :innocent:) . But life was not always the same. 🙄 I was born (in this world of software) - as a Manual tester. . . Well, I had never been a studious child :grimacing: - but programming always intrigued me. So, when I was placed in an MNC from college on-campus recruitment drive - believe me - I was super pumped up. . I even imagined solving tricky situations with my coding analytics :sunglasses:- you know - how a struggling actor feels he will re-enact a scene better than the original cast - until he faces the reality - that he is still nowhere near to be discovered, let alone being cast for “that” role. :persevere: . I felt the same churn in my stomach when I realized :broken_heart: - there was absolutely “no coding” requirement in my job profile. Many of you might disagree with me - and say - if you love to code, you will find the requirements in your daily activity. But trust me - with the work pressure - there is no “free” space of mind or time to analyze my daily activities. And then to know “WHAT” to use to automate it. . . So, today as I sit back and reminisce - I feel an urge to share how things worked out for me. I had been searching for these answers on different channels - Quora, Medium and what not. And only to believe - it is never going to happen.:disappointed: . But it did happen, and I want you to believe the same. I have finally mustered the courage to share my journey with you, not what has happened but also - what is happening. I will try to capture the different “technical” and “non-technical” patches of activities in this series of blog posts - and make it interactive to my best possible way. I hope the dreamers in all of you do hold on to your dreams while we embark on this journey.. See you in the next post.. Okka bye 👩🏻‍💻 .",
