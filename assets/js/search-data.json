            "content": "Hello 👋🏼 . So, continuing from where I left off last week. (Where did I leave off last week? 🤔 What is this story all about? Do you need to go back and read all previous chapters? 😟 - Don’t worry about these questions 🙃 I am just sharing my journey from a Tester to a Developer. Each post 📄 is like a summary of a string of events that led ➡️ the path) . And the regulars who have been with me from sometime now - do you have an answer? Any pattern in “what I did wrong?” . The answer is - I feared being judged as incapable. I yearned for too much acceptance from others - but forgot the simple trick - I need to accept myself first. . Now the second dangling topic from last post - what is an Automation Maintenance Engineer? Well, this was when I mentioned my role to be that of an Automation Tester, but all I ever did was fix “broken” tests. Oh no no - not fix broken scripts - fix broken tests (on excel sheet - changing test data, adding new keywords 😒) . Please don’t assume that it was an easy task, because the quantity of test suites was huge. We had almost 8-10 applications which were candidates of automation. 😨 Out of those - few had regression1 suites of 700-800 test cases that had to be run every fortnight. I still remember - we had 5-6 spare desktops in our project - we called them “middle systems” - for running automation. And we literally used to run between them: to monitor, to trigger, to check results and what not. Even today I do not know if “Automated” tests could need so much of “Physical” effort 🏃🏻‍♀️😫 . It was not a single technology- we had a hybrid framework with Selenium, 5 different frameworks with UFT, 1 with Sikuli plus multiple “scripts” to ease 😏 the effort. . . In the burden of managing all of this, coding something new was never a priority. Yet, the worm 🐛 of coding made me do funny things. A senior once told - “I understand you love coding, but don’t write a new method on every opportunity.” . So, yes - that is what I did for more than 2 years - maintained some automation suites, triggered them, reran the failed ones and scratched my head trying to figure out if the failed test is because of an actual bug or just a “sporadic” issue. This could have easily been a red flag - because I was not learning the technology - I was exhausted by the end of the day. 😮‍💨 I was stuck between knowing “I am not skilled enough for a job change” and “I don’t have time to work on self learning”. . Meanwhile I planned to pursue higher studies. I appeared for “GATE” and “GRE” - but as you can easily guess - did not achieve the required score because “Not enough time”. I heard whispers of people - saying- oh Manual testing is end of career, you would not make far with it. So my only option out seemed via higher studies - and I failed there too. 😭 . (P.S - My personal opinion - Manual testing is never going out of business - because it is not only testing the set of existing test suite - it is about the thought - how can the system break. It has its own importance.) . Now, looking back, I realize - higher studies was never for me. I have never been studious, so even if I had made it to an elite institution - I would still be a back-bench-er. Being focused is very important to make an optimized move. Also, if I was unable to learn or grow in the current position, I should have started applying elsewhere. While appearing for interviews, I could have understood the market requirements, prepared myself. . In that “confused space” - I thought everyone else is doing better. Someone was switching to a different company with a hike, someone pursuing MBA/MTech, someone traveling to onsite location. I blamed myself for wanting to be a Developer 😡- because I started to believe that it won’t ever happen. . . ▶️ The first rule of getting through this confusion is - listen to everything but don’t try to apply the same formula to your life. Not every medicine is effective for everyone - the prescription will be different. Once I started cutting out the unwanted information - I realized what I wanted. . ▶️ Secondly, people will tell you what they think is the best for you - but honestly - no one knows what is going to happen. So if you feel like, take risks. Do what you want to do. You are answerable to only yourself. . ▶️ Finally - my stint as “Automation Maintenance Engineer” was not all waste. I learnt handling frequent context switches, I learnt “not breaking” under pressure. And I would definitely say - I had great seniors at work. So I was never reprimanded for mistakes. I was still given more responsibilities - which helped me build the confidence in myself. . And special mention to my first manager - who has always been there to hear my childish blabbering, never being impatient. I still remember a very important thing he said - “Even if you do move to development, the testing will always be an additional skill. This, which is your bread and butter right now, will always give you that extra edge”. I learnt from him, how to be a leader - not a “boss”. . The next chapter will unfold my first “proper” automation task - and then a big change… So see you next Tuesday.. Okka, Bye 👩🏻‍💻 . regression - When any new feature/changes are introduced in an application (think app updates with new features) - the existing features should be tested - ‘coz no one likes “Oh why is this not working, it used to work!! 😠😩”. This is regression testing. &#8617; . |",

            "content": "Hello Readers 👋🏼 So glad that you are here. . Recap 📜 : I am a software developer now, after 7 years of being a QA engineer. The original journey was that of a Manual Tester → Automation Maintenance Engineer (I know that is not even a term but you will soon relate to it) → Automation Engineer → Software Developer. In the last 2 posts, I began telling you the story of how it all began and how I managed to get noticed as capable of being an automation engineer. . . So, once my first project ended, the entire team was split up and absorbed into different projects. . I was to fill in the shoes 👠of one stalwart automation engineer. I still remember my first introduction to Selenium 🤖- I was handed an excel file with some existing test cases, some keywords, data, test steps - and a 30 minutes of “How to run”. I did not ask 😓- what is Selenium, where is it being used, how does it work - nothing. I came back to my desk, and worked on the setup - triggered a test case which ran all green 🟢. . . There were instances in future where I was asked to provide “KT or Knowledge Transfer” sessions 👩‍🏫 on Selenium - and I always feared of teaching it wrong, of not knowing an answer 😟. . Hey stop..✋ don’t think I am trying to cut a sorry picture. Let me now go back and share the analysis of what I did wrong and how I made/could have made it right. . . Wrong: . Not asking- be it a question, assistance or guidance. | Being a perfectionist - no mistakes allowed. ❌ | Right: . Ensuring delivery - this is the key 🗝️ in building trust 🤝 and being valued. | Improved “Google Search”. 🔍 (Well yes it can be any search, but Google is what I used and still do use 😅) . It is not just me, various posts on different platforms do mention “being able to Google” as a sought after skill - because trust me - no one knows it all - you just need to know what to look for. 😉💡 . | Teaching. 👩🏻‍🏫 I learnt with total honesty- because I knew that I could not impart incorrect information. | Investigative attitude 🕵🏼 . A question I did not have an answer to made me all the more curious. This helped me later in many “root cause analysis”. | Absolute honest efforts. This helped me gain a long term foothold on subjects I worked in. | Observe 👀, analyze, learn, repeat 🔃 | What could have been done differently: . Ask. Questions, requests for sessions, documentation - anything that you might need to gear up - go ahead and ask for it. It helps in 2 main ways : You are ready to deliver much faster 🚀- team is benefited | You make less ignorant mistakes 🤦🏽‍♀️ 📉. | ⚠️ Some terms and conditions applied to the above ⚠️ . ** There is a thin line between “spoon feeding” 🥣 and “requesting for help when required” 🆘. Ensure that you have tried everything you could, before approaching someone. Respect everyone’s time. . ** Have specific and constructive asks - Instead of “I need a session on Selenium”, a better question is “How is of Selenium implemented in the current project?” . | I know I am still not there yet - but try to overcome the “self- doubt”. You know you will be able to prove yourself - just not yet - but soon. 🍀 | Spend time on learning ✏️🗓️- it is the most difficult thing. And don’t make it a “resolution”. Breaking a “resolution” makes us lose the battle half way - so learn whenever you can and you feel like. There is so much knowledge and such little time - it is very easy to get derailed. No one-shot formula of learning that works for all - I can only share what works for me. I can only motivate myself to learn things that need me to get a job done. So I always try to learn things while working on them - being curious and asking more “whys”. 🤔 | Well,well - A lot of “preaching” 😄 But now a question for you .. Did you observe any pattern in “what I did wrong”? You have 1 week to think.. Till then.. Keep dreaming.. . Psst.. What is “Automation Maintenance Engineer”? Stay tuned for next blog 😜 . Okka bye 👋🏼 👩🏻‍💻 .",

            "content": "Hello 👋🏼 - I am back. I hope you have already read the prelude here 👇🏼 . How I moved to being a developer from a tester… . If you haven’t - well just go on reading this post - I am glad you are here and would respect your time - so no need to go back and read right now 🙆🏻‍♀️ . So - where was I .. Ah yes! How a QA engineer (tester)🔍🐞 with more than half a decade of experience moved to being a developer 👩🏻‍💻. Well, honestly - when I started as a manual tester - from day 1 (or probably the day I understood what my job requires) - I started requesting for a role change. . I, in no way want to demean the role, and slowly you will realize how much my previous role helps my current one. Only - I love absolute honesty and that is how I will present myself - my exact thoughts at each stage, my decisions, what I missed and what I grabbed. . . In large MNCs - there is mostly no process of determining who should be tagged :link: to which technology. In a batch of 1000 students :busts_in_silhouette: - no one has the time to judge your capabilities - and my fate landed me in a batch of Manual Testing. Initially people kept saying - this is great, it means quick onsite opportunities :airplane:- I really did not know what the role was and was thrilled at this suggestion. As soon as the training unfolded - I realized I did not want onsite at the cost of “no coding”. Terms like “automation”, “white/black/gray box” were aboslutely new - and I knew all I had to work with was “Decoding requirements and wording tests”. I started slipping into hopelessness by the day. . . Guidance matters - and I had none. No one told me that it was okay to look for another job right then - so I continued. I kept on working at writing test cases in excel sheets, manually executing them, learning the domain and the most important of all - understanding requirements. Whenever there was an opportunity - I did not forget to highlight my aspirations - I knew movement to development was almost not possible but the closest I could move to code was being an “Automation Engineer”. . . And I took up every opportunity of building something in-house - failing at almost every task - because I had No Guidance. I did not know what frameworks were, I did not know how to develop websites - it all looked so dreamy, magical and out of reach :sob:. When I was told to contribute in an Android :iphone: application that was being built in-house - I could not understand anything:dizzy_face: in the 2 days provided to learn, and faltered to deliver. I kept losing faith in myself - but today when I look back, the only thing that is visible is - the scenario was bound to fail. I cannot expect myself to create a production ready UX design in just 2 days of learning android development. And it is Okay. :purple_heart: Many times we fail some tests because the tests are wrong - you cannot expect a baby bird to fly in a day. :hatching_chick: . But I proved my mettle wherever possible. I never backed out on any added responsibilities - and delivered more than what was expected. One day, out of the blue, I got a message from a friend in a different team - that an automation training was being organized for a new batch of trainees. I decided to go out of my way and ask my manager to enroll me in the training. It was not an easy talk - it really took a lot of reasoning and a little bit of displeasure, topped with extra working hours - but I finally got what I wanted. 1 week of training, going to office early and working late to compensate for the work - all did help in one main thing - I got noticed. :raising_hand: . So as soon as my current project ended - after a long tenure (at least for me) of 1 year - I was presented with the role of an Automation engineer in another project. . What happened next you say? Stay tuned for the next chapter the upcoming week.. Till then.. Okka Bye 👩🏻‍💻 .",

            "content": "Hi, let me introduce myself first. I am Moniseeta - a “Software Developer” in one of the leading cloud native security providers. (Which one? I will reveal but not yet :innocent:) . But life was not always the same. 🙄 I was born (in this world of software) - as a Manual tester. . . Well, I had never been a studious child :grimacing: - but programming always intrigued me. So, when I was placed in an MNC from college on-campus recruitment drive - believe me - I was super pumped up. . I even imagined solving tricky situations with my coding analytics :sunglasses:- you know - how a struggling actor feels he will re-enact a scene better than the original cast - until he faces the reality - that he is still nowhere near to be discovered, let alone being cast for “that” role. :persevere: . I felt the same churn in my stomach when I realized :broken_heart: - there was absolutely “no coding” requirement in my job profile. Many of you might disagree with me - and say - if you love to code, you will find the requirements in your daily activity. But trust me - with the work pressure - there is no “free” space of mind or time to analyze my daily activities. And then to know “WHAT” to use to automate it. . . So, today as I sit back and reminisce - I feel an urge to share how things worked out for me. I had been searching for these answers on different channels - Quora, Medium and what not. And only to believe - it is never going to happen.:disappointed: . But it did happen, and I want you to believe the same. I have finally mustered the courage to share my journey with you, not what has happened but also - what is happening. I will try to capture the different “technical” and “non-technical” patches of activities in this series of blog posts - and make it interactive to my best possible way. I hope the dreamers in all of you do hold on to your dreams while we embark on this journey.. See you in the next post.. Okka bye 👩🏻‍💻 .",
