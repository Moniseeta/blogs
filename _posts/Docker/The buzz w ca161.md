Have you ever wondered what this buzz about Docker is all about? 🤔 Well yes, it has been in market for a long time, it might not be something “new” or “trending” - but Python too first appeared in 1991 and well - the crazy following and learning still continues. So if you are new to Docker or have been curious about it - I hope this blog series will help you.

I first heard of Docker from a senior in my first company. He was building a “dockerized” application and wanted to include me in the project. Me being me - jumped at the opportunity and started reading about Docker. But I literally understood nothing. 😐

Today, do I know everything about Docker? Not at all. Maybe just enough to write about - why Docker. 

I have planned this series in this format:

→ Working with Virtual Machines

→ Difference between VMs and Containerization

→ CRIs (Container Runtime Engines)

→ Docker

→ CRIO and Containerd

→ Orchestrators.

Keeping it really short this time - just to give you a glimpse of what's next. So from next Tuesday onwards - lets discover all of this together.
