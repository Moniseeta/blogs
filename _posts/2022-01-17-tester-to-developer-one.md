title: How I moved to being a developer from a tester...
---

Hi, let me introduce myself first. I am Moniseeta - a “Software Developer” in one of the leading cloud native security providers. (Which one? I will reveal but not yet :innocent:)

But life was not always the same. 🙄 I was born (in this world of software) - as a Manual tester.

Well, I had never been a studious child :grimacing: - but programming always intrigued me. So, when I was placed in an MNC from college on-campus recruitment drive - believe me - I was super pumped up. 

I even imagined solving tricky situations with my coding analytics :sunglasses:- you know - how a struggling actor feels he will re-enact a scene better than the original cast - until he faces the reality - that he is still nowhere near to be discovered, let alone being cast for “that” role. :persevere:


I felt the same churn in my stomach when I realized :broken_heart: - there was absolutely “no coding” requirement in my job profile. Many of you might disagree with me - and say - if you love to code, you will find the requirements in your daily activity. But trust me - with the work pressure - there is no “free” space of mind or time to analyze my daily activities. And then to know “WHAT” to use to automate it.

So, today as I sit back and reminisce - I feel an urge to share how things worked out for me. I had been searching for these answers on different channels - Quora, Medium and what not. And only to believe - it is never going to happen.:disappointed: 

<b>But it did happen, and I want you to believe the same.</b> I have finally mustered the courage to share my journey with you, not what has happened but also - what is happening. I will try to capture the different “technical” and “non-technical” patches of activities in this series of blog posts - and make it interactive to my best possible way. I hope the dreamers in all of you do hold on to your dreams while we embark on this journey.. See you in the next post.. Okka bye 👩🏻‍💻
