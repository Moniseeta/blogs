Hello Readers 👋🏼 So glad that you are here. 

Recap 📜 : I am a software developer now, after 7 years of being a QA engineer. The original journey was that of a Manual Tester → Automation Maintenance Engineer (I know that is not even a term but you will soon relate to it) → Automation Engineer → Software Developer. In the last 2 posts, I began telling you the story of how it all began and how I managed to get noticed as capable of being an automation engineer.

So, once my first project ended, the entire team was split up and absorbed into different projects. 

I was to fill in the shoes 👠of one stalwart automation engineer. I still remember my first introduction to Selenium 🤖- I was handed an excel file with some existing test cases, some keywords, data, test steps - and a 30 minutes of “How to run”. I did not ask 😓- what is Selenium, where is it being used, how does it work - nothing. I came back to my desk, and worked on the setup - triggered a test case which ran all green 🟢.

There were instances in future where I was asked to provide “KT or Knowledge Transfer” sessions 👩‍🏫 on Selenium - and I always feared of teaching it wrong, of not knowing an answer 😟.

Hey stop..✋ don’t think I am trying to cut a sorry picture. Let me now go back and share the analysis of what I did wrong and how I made/could have made it right.

**Wrong**: 

1. Not asking- be it a question, assistance or guidance.
2. Being a perfectionist - no mistakes allowed. ❌

**Right**:

1. Ensuring delivery - this is the key 🗝️ in building trust 🤝 and being valued.
2. Improved “Google Search”. 🔍 (Well yes it can be any search, but Google is what I used and still do use 😅)
    
    It is not just me, various posts on different platforms do mention “being able to Google” as a sought after skill - because trust me - no one knows it all - you just need to know what to look for. 😉💡
    
3. Teaching. 👩🏻‍🏫 I learnt with total honesty- because I knew that I could not impart incorrect information.
4. Investigative attitude 🕵🏼 . A question I did not have an answer to made me all the more curious. This helped me later in many "root cause analysis".
5. Absolute honest efforts. This helped me gain a long term foothold on subjects I worked in.
6. Observe 👀, analyze, learn, repeat 🔃

**What could have been done differently**:

1. Ask. Questions, requests for sessions, documentation - anything that you might need to gear up - go ahead and ask for it. It helps in 2 main ways :
    1. You are ready to deliver much faster 🚀- team is benefited 
    2. You make less ignorant mistakes 🤦🏽‍♀️ 📉.

    ⚠️ Some terms and conditions applied to the above ⚠️

    ** There is a thin line between “spoon feeding” 🥣 and “requesting for help when required” 🆘. Ensure that you have tried everything you could, before approaching someone. Respect everyone’s time.

    ** Have specific and constructive asks - Instead of “I need a session on Selenium”, a better question is “How is <some concept> of Selenium implemented in the current project?”
2. I know I am still not there yet - but try to overcome the “self- doubt”. You know you will be able to prove yourself - just not yet - but soon. 🍀
3. Spend time on learning ✏️🗓️- it is the most difficult thing. And don’t make it a “resolution”. **Breaking a “resolution” makes us lose the battle half way - so learn whenever you can and you feel like.** There is so much knowledge and such little time - it is very easy to get derailed. No one-shot formula of learning that works for all - I can only share what works for me. I can only motivate myself to learn things that need me to get a job done. So I always try to learn things while working on them - being curious and asking more “whys”. 🤔

Well,well - A lot of “preaching” 😄 But now a question for you .. Did you observe any pattern in “what I did wrong”? You have 1 week to think.. Till then.. Keep dreaming.. 

Psst.. What is “Automation Maintenance Engineer”? Stay tuned for next blog 😜

Okka bye 👋🏼 👩🏻‍💻
